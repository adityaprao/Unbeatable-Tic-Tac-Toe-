## Introduction
This unbeatable Tic Tac Toe game is based on the Minimax algorithm, which evaluates a few steps ahead of the current position and puts itself in the position of its opponent, much like a skilled chess player. It continues to play ahead until it reaches a terminal board configuration (terminal state), resulting in a tie, a win, or a loss. Once in a terminal condition, the AI will arbitrarily give a win a positive score (+X), a defeat  gets a negative score (-X) or a draw gets a neutral score (0).

At the same time, the algorithm evaluates the moves that lead to a terminal state based on the players’ turn. It will choose the move with maximum score when it is the AI’s turn and choose the move with the minimum score when it is the human player’s turn. Using this strategy, Minimax avoids losing to the human player.

With the help of this backtracking algorithm, it ensures that it becomes unbeatable.
